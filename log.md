# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Project: Multiplayer Online Tic-tac-toe
I finished the basic game logic, both server side and client side

**Thoughts** 
I just started learning how to write automated tests (unit, integration and end-to-end) so I will have to start implementing some testing methodologies like pair-wise or something else. That's the only one I know of because it has a minimal amount of tests for 70%-80% coverage. 

Learned: 
Arrays aren't meant to have key value names and can behave weridly when doing so. Socket.io cannot send array items that have key value pairs, it instead just sends and empty array. So I had to switch to using an object.
