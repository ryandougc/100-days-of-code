# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 29, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**

Project: Multiplayer Online Tic-tac-toe
I finished the basic game logic, both server side and client side

**Thoughts** 

I just started learning how to write automated tests (unit, integration and end-to-end) so I will have to start implementing some testing methodologies like pair-wise or something else. That's the only one I know of because it has a minimal amount of tests for 70%-80% coverage. 

Learned: 
Arrays aren't meant to have key value names and can behave weridly when doing so. Socket.io cannot send array items that have key value pairs, it instead just sends and empty array. So I had to switch to using an object.

### Day 1: April 30, Thursday

**Today's Progress**

Project: Multiplayer Online Tic-tac-toe
I implemented the chat feature and styled the game page. I also incorporated a dark mode toggle button, which works.

**Thoughts** 
The hardest part for me right now is remembering to post on social media. I posted a photo on isntagram but it was very late. I forced myself to post something that didn't look good but it was what I had gotten done and I'm happy that I could atleast post something.

Learned: 
To push myself to follow through with what I said I would do even though I wasn't happy with the work I was showing.
